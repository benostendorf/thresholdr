## Introduction
Say you have size measurements of multiple objects over an extended time. You might be interested in assessing the time (or latency)

* until (and if) these objects reach a given threshold size
* the latency it takes objects to advance from one threshold to another

As an applied example, you might ask who long it takes trees to reach a certain size after planting and how long it takes them to reach a certain size *after* they have reached a given size.

The *thresholdr* package provides auxiliary functions to generate tables that can be used to easily calculate and plot these metrics.
